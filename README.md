=========================

            

Building Azure user-defined route tables, or custom route tables, requires a number of steps in PowerShell to create and then apply. 


Set-AzureCustomRouteTable assists in creating and modifying Azure route tables. The function will create a new route table if it doesn't exist, or modify a route table if it does exist. Additionally the route table can be applied to an existing subnet in
 an Azure virtual network. Requires Azure PowerShell module. 


 

 

        
    
TechNet gallery is retiring! This script was migrated from TechNet script center to GitHub by Microsoft Azure Automation product group. All the Script Center fields like Rating, RatingCount and DownloadCount have been carried over to Github as-is for the migrated scripts only. Note : The Script Center fields will not be applicable for the new repositories created in Github & hence those fields will not show up for new Github repositories.
